Spring Boot is a brand new framework from the team at Pivotal, designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of a new Spring application. 
The framework takes an opinionated approach to configuration, freeing developers from the need to define boilerplate configuration. 
In that, Boot aims to be a front-runner in the ever-expanding rapid application development space.
